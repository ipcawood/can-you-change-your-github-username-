# can-you-change-your-github-username-
Hi there, I'm asking for your help. It does not appear that you use your github. Is there any possibility you might be able to **rename your GitHub username** from petra to anything else? This will allow me to claim this name for my organization? reply: ipcawood@gmail.com

I would greatly appreciate this if it is possible! No worries, if not :) 

### **Steps to Rename Your GitHub Username:**

1. **Go to your GitHub Account Settings**:  
   - Click on your **profile picture** in the top-right corner, and then click **Settings**.

2. **Rename Your Username**:  
   - In the **Account Settings** section, you'll see your **current username**.
   - Change your username to something else.
   - After renaming, click **Update username** to apply the change.
